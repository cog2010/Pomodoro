Pomodoro clock for FreeCodeCamp

The Pomodoro clock is used to determine working and break times. The standard durations are 25 min of work and 5 min of break,
  but these time frames can be changed to any number of minutes by the user.
 
Future Plans:
  *Manually entering the number of minutes with the keyboard
